I also learn multiple Technologies and build independent projects. I am specially interested in Web Development, PWA and React. If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt CareFi, I have learned how to build product, manage people, be part of a team and build on-line predictive models with technologies like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), [ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [ant](https://ant.design/). I primarily work as a Front-End Developer but like to contribute in every path of the product be it Planning, Design and specially Backend .\n\n# Some history\n\n- I loved playing mobile games as a kid and would spend hours on my Parent's phone.\n\n- At 11, After seeing my love and curiosity with Mobile and Technology my parents bought me a [Samsung Galaxy Pocket](https://gadgets360.com/samsung-galaxy-pocket-539).\n\n- At 13, I discovered the art of soldering and started assembling keypad mobile phones for our mobile repair shop. I also stated collecting magnet inside the speakers by opening the old phones. Broke some sim cards as well, lol.\n\n- Next two years were spent exploring youtube and Internet to learn about General knowledge, science and most importantly Songs.\n\n- At 10, I built my first website with Microsoft FrontPage on our Pentium III [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway,_Inc.). My website was terrible.\n\n- I was 11 when I built my first [Tesla Coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_coil) (without the permission of my parents). Over the next few years, I built several more including one of the first audio modulated coils and one of the first DRSSTCs.\n\n- When I was 12, I set the all-time high record at my local laser tag facility by reverse engineering the charging station and weapon protocols with a photo-resistor, micro-cassette recorder, and a lot of patience. I was unstoppable.\n\n- At 13, I went to space camp and fell in love. I went back two more times and promised myself that I'd work in space. I've since helped build three generations of satellites and have contributed to two more.\n\n- At 14, I was almost expelled for finding a backdoor into my high school's file server and telling everyone but the faculty members about it. Later that year, I figured out how to turn off the internet firewall by editing system registry keys. I anonymously shared my work months later.\n\n- At 16, I participated in a foreign exchange program in Dortmund, Germany. Since then, I've gone back almost every year.\n\n- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Counter Strike Source, Command and Conquer 3, Halo 2, and Age of Empires II.\n\n- At 18, In the summer before college, my friends and I started playing [Muggle Quidditch](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(sport)>). We went on to start over 8 teams in the [International Quidditch Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Quidditch_Association) including the [Buffalo Quidditch Society](https://www.facebook.com/buffaloquidditch/). At our height, we were ranked third in the IQA. Although I don't play anymore, you can still see pictures of me holding a broom while wearing a chess camp t-shirt on facebook.\n\n- At 19, I took my first graduate course and published my first academic paper.\n\n- At 20, I co-authored a grant to build a satellite and managed a 60+ person team for the next two years. You can read more about that [here](https://ubnl.space/glados/).\n\nAsk me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.\n\n# I like\n\n- Running\n- Skiing\n- Sailing and the sea\n- Space\n- Summer\n- [Books](https://www.goodreads.com/mdangelo)\n- Colored pencils ([Faber-Castell Polychromos](https://www.faber-castell.com/products/art-and-graphic/polychromos))\n- Podcasts ([The Daily](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-daily), [Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/), [The Indicator](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510325/the-indicator-from-planet-money), [This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/), [99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/episodes/), [The Economist](http://radio.economist.com/), [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/radiolab), [Hidden Brain](https://www.npr.org/series/423302056/hidden-brain), [Inquiring Minds](https://inquiring.show), and others)\n- [Good design](/)\n- [Photography](https://instagram.com/dangelosaurus)\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Mumbai, Maharashtra.
